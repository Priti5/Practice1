One of the finest specimens of architecture in the city is Shaniwar Wada, a 286-year-old mansion that was originally the Peshwa capital of Pune.
Peshwa Bajirao I himself constructed this mansion to serve as the home of Peshwas.

Although the Wada now spans 625 acres, it nearly engulfed the entire city during its prominence.
With many forts, fountains, and the imposing statue of Baji Rao I that welcomes guests at the entry, the location never fails to astound visitors.
